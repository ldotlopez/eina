        <h2>Your music belongs to you</h2>

<p>Current music players are focused on managing your music collection, while using mandatory criteria about how they organize it.</p>

<p>Eina does not care about it at all. If your are an organized person, chances are your music collection is organized too, and you won't like to spend your time rearranging it to follow your player's specific rules. In addition, having those players to arrange music that's randomly stored, named or tagged, is usually counterproductive.</p>

<h2>Get all functionality</h2>

<p>Eina works like a common portable music player. Just plays what you want to listen.</p>

<p>Apart from simplicity, today users expect more from a player than just reading files. Artwork, lyrics, network support, artist data and other music information find their right place in Eina.</p>

<p>Plugins can take care of all the extra functionality, since Eina exposes everything from its internals. It's fairly easy to extend the player capabilities and change the way it works inside. Feel free to request new features and make things the way you like.</p>

<h2>Based on free technology</h2>

<p>Eina is written in plain C, using Gtk+-3.0 for the graphic interface and GStreamer for playback.
Gtk means portatility, accesibility, and internationalization. GStreamer means extensibility and support for every audio format out there. These two elements make Eina an unlimited application. (Someone said emacs support?)</p>

<p>By the way, Eina is also free (as in free beer) software. Eina is licensed under GPL-2 or later.</p>
