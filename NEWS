- New IO Layer
  Better and consistent sorting and loading.

- New pluggable cover widget
  Now plugins can render cover, Eina itself includes the classic
  cover and a 3D-enabled cover (clutter-gtk required).

- Updated documentation
  Almost all APIs from liblomo are documented, more to come on the
  next release.

- More DBus API
  DBus signals and methods from liblomo are almost completed.

- Gtk 3.0 Ready
  Eina depends on zero deprecated modules and compiles with GSeal
  enable, so Eina is ready for gtk/gnome 3.0

- Packaging improvements
  Now Eina can be renamed to eina-player or foo-bar or whatever,
  distributions now can avoid conflicts with other 'eina' packages.

- Lots of minor bugfixes
  This release refines Eina internals, less crashes expected.

- Improved usability
  There are some changes in Eina's UI to make it more user-friendly
