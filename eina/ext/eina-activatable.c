 * @short_description: Interface for activatable plugins.
 * @see_also: #PeasExtensionSet
 *
 * #EinaActivatable is an interface which should be implemented by plugins
 * that should be activated on an object of a certain type (depending on the
 * application). For instance, in a typical windowed application,
 * #EinaActivatable plugin instances could be bound to individual toplevel
 * windows.
 *
 * It is typical to use #EinaActivatable along with #PeasExtensionSet in order
 * to activate and deactivate extensions automatically when plugins are loaded
 * or unloaded.
 *
 * You can also use the code of this interface as a base for your own
 * extension types, as illustrated by gedit's #GeditWindowActivatable and
 * #GeditDocumentActivatable interfaces.
