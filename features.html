		<h3>There's no need for a library</h3>
		<p>Our philosophy is all about playing music. Eina will not try to organize your music collection in its own way; it won't even try to build a library out of your files. Just drag the files or folders containing what you want to play and let it do its job. Eina does provide history and search functions for your convenience.</p>
