This is a guide to building eina on OS X. This guide assumes that you are
already familiar with building gtk+ software on OS X (natively) using jhbuild.
Please make sure to read https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX/Building
before proceeding.

Note: Terminal commands are preceded by dollar signs.

1) Building eina for OS X
=============================================================================

Get and install the gtk-osx-build-setup.sh from:
http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

$ curl -O http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/gtk-osx-build-setup.sh
$ sh gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

Some of the newer releases of gnome software are only providing .xz packages.
To be able to extract the contents of these packages, you will need to install
xz utils. The easiest way to install is to use a dmg package available on:

http://macpkg.sourceforge.net/

Make sure to include /usr/local/bin in your PATH and alsothat you are not
conflicting anything from fink/macports. If you are using fink/macports, you
can add the following to your ~/.bashrc to remove any PATHS related to 
fink/macports when using jhbuild:

    # Add /usr/local/bin
    export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

    # Remove fink/macports path from PATH and store in local var origpath
    origpath=$(echo $PATH | sed -E -e 's;:?/opt/local/bin;;' -e 's;:?/opt/local/sbin;;')

    # Alias jhbuild
    alias jhbuild="PATH=$origpath:$HOME/.local/bin jhbuild"

For eina we need to modify some configuration for jhbuild. A special
jhbuildrc is provided in the eina source (osx/jhbuild/jhbuildrc-eina). Copy
this file to your home.

$ curl -o ~/.jhbuildrc-eina https://raw.github.com/ldotlopez/eina/osx/osx/jhbuildrc-eina

eina provides a custom moduleset for jhbuild that you can use to built eina. This moduleset is specified in jhbuildrc-eina (together with some other
configurations for jhbuild specific for eina).

To use the special eina jhbuild configuration you will have to set the
environment variables JHB=eina and EINA_SDK=<sdk>. Where <sdk> is the SDK
version you want to built for (i.e. 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, etc.).

IMPORTANT: jhbuildrc-eina will call setup_sdk for the right sdk. However, by
default setup_sdk is already called from ~/.jhbuildrc-custom. Please make sure
to comment out the call to setup_sdk in ~/.jhbuildrc-custom!

Finally we are ready to built eina:

$ JHB=eina EINA_SDK=10.6 jhbuild bootstrap --ignore-system
$ JHB=eina EINA_SDK=10.6 jhbuild build eina-meta

Note that it's perfectly possible that something might fail during the built,
as the OS X (quartz) port of eina, gtk+, glib etc. is under development.
Please feel free to drop by on IRC or send an e-mail to the eina mailing list
(or gtk-osx-users mailing list) if you are not able to make things work.

Packages will be downloaded in ~/Source/eina-sdk/pkgs. Sources are extracted in ~/Source/eina-sdk/<sdk>/source and installation of the binaries is in ~/Source/eina-sdk/<sdk>/inst.
 

2) Making a eina bundle
=============================================================================

You can make a eina bundle (i.e. a eina.app) with a script provided by
eina. Note that you have to execute script from within the jhbuild shell:

$ JHB=eina EINA_SDK=10.6 jhbuild shell

Then, go to the osx directory in the eina source and execute:

$ sh makebundle.sh

If succeeded, you will now have a eina.app bundle in the osx directory.
Similarly, if you want to built the final dmg image, you can use the script
makedmg.sh
